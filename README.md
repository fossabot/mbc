# MBC - Symmetric Encryption Algorithm by Mattyw&MeBeiM #

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS** *(check `developing` branch)*.

This repository will provide a C library for the *mbc symmetric encryption algorithm*, plus a parametric CLI program for `stdio` usage.

NB: This is a remake of the [mbencrypter](1) project, however the new alghorithm is not compatible.

## Algorithm Description ##

### Per-Byte XOR encoding ###
- If the key is shorter than data, it will be cycled until the end of data.
- If data is shorter than the key, it will be cycled until the end of the key.
- Each byte of data is XORed with each byte of the key.

### Bit-Swap encoding, by MeBeiM ###
- The key is converted into an octal sequence *(see [notes.md](2) for the detailed mechanism)*.
- Each pair of numbers in the sequence indicate to swap the corrispective n-th bits of each byte of data.
- A long and randomic key makes the algorithm more effective.
